Example algorithmic analysis:
INPUT: "Quantum computing uses quantum bits or qubits to perform computations. Unlike classical bits that must be either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition. This exponentially increases computational power, potentially breaking all current encryption and revolutionizing artificial intelligence, drug discovery, and climate modeling."
